Description: Deployment using mod_wsgi and apache. Below instructions will tell you how to quickly deploy your turbogears2 app using mod_wsgi.
        
        Install modwsgideploy
        ---------------------
        
        PYPI
        ~~~~
        
        You can install modwsgideploy from PyPi::
        
         easy_install modwsgideploy
         #or
         pip install modwsgideploy
        
        Done.
        
        Run modwsgideploy
        ------------------
        
        Go into your python application project folder and type in::
        
         paster modwsgi_deploy
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Here is a typical installation, from start to finish on Debian Linux. You might have to use you OS specific commands for installing apache.
        
        The steps are:
        1) Install apache and modwsgi
        2) Setup virtual environment and install you web application written in pyramid,etc
        3) Install modwsgideploy and run the paster command above to generate all the configuration files.
        4) Tweak wsgi/apache settings to fit your needs or use default settings.
        5) Check if everything is running properly.
        
        In this case I will install apache using tools available from my Linux operating system::
        
         apt-get install apache2
         apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
         virtualenv -p python3 --no-site-packages env_py3
         source env_py3/bin/activate
         pip install modwsgideploy
        
         Go into you app and run modwsgi_deploy command::
        
         cd myapp
         paster modwsgi_deploy
        
        You should see an apache folder like this inside 'myapp'::
        
         myapp
         |-- apache
         |   |-- README.txt
         |   |-- myapp.conf
         |   |-- myapp.wsgi
         |   `-- test.wsgi
        
        
        1. Read the README.txt
        2. myapp.conf is a apache2 configuration file that you need to copy into your apache2 configuration folder after all the settings are set.
        3. myapp.wsgi is an modwsgi script that is called from myapp apache2 file
        4. test.wsgi is a test script that you can call to see if you modwsgi was properly installed and working.
        
        Edit myapp.conf file to change any paths and/or apache configurations. Then copy to apache2 folder.
        
        On Debian Linux operating system I copy this file to::
        
         cp ./apache2/myapp.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
        
        Enable the website. On my OS its::
        
         a2ensite myapp.conf
         /etc/init.d/apache restart
        
        Done

        Source Install
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You also have a choice of getting the source and installing it.
        You should use this in a virtual environment, for example::
        
         virtalenv -p python3 --no-site-packages env_py3
         source env_py3/bin/activate
        
        Install [:git:] if its not already installed on your system::
        
         apt-get install git
        
        Branch out the code. This will pull all the revision history. If you want just the recent one use checkout::
        
         git clone https://code.launchpad.net/~szybalski/modwsgideploy/modwsgideploy
        
        Install it::
        
         cd modwsgideploy/modwsgideploy
         python setup.py develop
